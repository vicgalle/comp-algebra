Fundamental Computer Algebra algorithms implemented in Maple


## euclides.mws


**Euclides algorithm for Z, Zp, Z[i], Q[X], Fp[X] and Fq[X] with q=p^n.**


 Euclides algorithm calculates the gcd of two elements using the subtraction operation.
 
 
(*) For example, gcd(126,35):
126 = 3*35 + 21;
35   = 1*21 + 14;
21   = 1*14 + 7;
14   = 2*7 ;

## extendedEuclides.mws

**Extended euclidean algorithm**

It computes the gcd of the given inputs and represents it as a linear combination, following the equalities (*) in the previous section in ascending order.

Some examples that use this function:

## additionProduct64.mws


**Addition and product in base 64.**

Numbers are unsigned and represented as integer lists. Take into consideration that the most significant position is the first in the right.

## polynomialIrreducibilityTest.mws

Finite field polynomial test of irreducibility.


We use that a polynomial f is irreducible if and only if:

(i) f divide x^(q^n)-x, y

(ii) gcd(x^(q^n/t)-x,f) = 1 fot all prime divisor t of n
